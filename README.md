# gmail-backup

## Introduction
I made this tool backup my emails. It is called gmail-backup (cause I use gmail) but it should work with any imap server using ssl. It has been developed with python ```3.6.2```. I don't know if it will work with python2. Let me know but PR are welcome ;)

## Installation
The installation is quite straight forward:

    git clone https://github.com/teintuc/gmail-backup.git
    cd gmail-backup
    sudo python setup.py install

## Usage
Just run:

    gmailbackup

The first time it will ask you some configuration in order to properly work.
